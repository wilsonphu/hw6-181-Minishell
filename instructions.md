# Minishell

## Overview

The goal in this assignment is to create an executable `minishell` that
runs a basic shell program. The shell must implement `cd` and `exit`
as built-ins, signal handling, and fork/exec for all other commands.

## Part 1

This program will involve making a shell. The main loop of this function should
print the current working directory (`man 2 getcwd`), then wait for user input. 
When the user input has been entered, the program should act accordingly.

The program will be called from the command line and will take no arguments. 
Note that this directory will be different when you run it but should not be hardcoded. 
The prompt always displays the current working directory in square brackets
followed immediately by a $ and a space.

    $ ./minishell

    [/home/user/minishell]$

## Part 2

*Please note that color does not work if you ssh from cygwin.
If you are on windows, you should ssh from the windows command prompt.*

The directory name in the command prompt should be printed in bright blue.
Place these color definitions beneath the includes of your minishell.c file.

    #define BRIGHTBLUE "\x1b[34;1m"
    #define DEFAULT    "\x1b[0m"

These strings will allow you to print to the terminal in bright blue or the default color for text, based on terminal's properties.

For example, to print just the string "Hello, world!" in bright blue, you would write

    printf("%sHello, world!\n", BRIGHTBLUE);

Adding the escape sequence to your string will change the color of anything printed after it, 
so if you want to return to printing in the default terminal color, make sure you switch it back in the printf() function call.

## Part 3

You will have to manually implement these commands (i.e. you can't exec them)

1. `cd`

    If `cd` is called with no arguments or the one argument ~, it
    should change the working directory to the user's home directory.
    Do NOT hard code any specific folder as the home directory.
    Instead work with the following:
    - `man 2 getuid`
    - `man 3 getpwuid`
    - `man 2 chdir`
    
    If `cd` is called with one argument that isn't ~, it should attempt to open the directory specified in that argument.

    Your cd also has to support ~ with trailing directory names, as in

        cd ~/Desktop

2. `exit`

    The `exit` command should cause the shell to terminate and return
    `EXIT_SUCCESS`. Using `exit` is the only way to stop shell's
    execution normally.

## Part 4

All other commands will be executed using `exec`. When an unknown
command is entered, the program forks. The child program will exec
the given command and the parent process will wait for the child
process to finish before returning to the prompt. You may assume that
no command contains more than 4096 characters, including '\0', and that
the total number of tokens (elements) on a line is no more than 2048,
including the trailing NULL to mark the end of the vector of tokens.

## Part 5

Errors for the system/function calls should be handled as they have in previous assignments. 
Your shell should exit gracefully in any error scenario with a detailed error message and should never crash. 
Errors for system/function calls should be handled as they have been in previous assignments. 
Some example error messages are included below. The last %s in each line below is a format specifier for `strerror(errno)`.

    "Error: Cannot get passwd entry. %s.\n"
    "Error: Cannot change directory to '%s'. %s.\n"
    "Error: Too many arguments to cd.\n"
    "Error: Failed to read from stdin. %s.\n"
    "Error: fork() failed. %s.\n"
    "Error: exec() failed. %s.\n"
    "Error: wait() failed. %s.\n"
    "Error: malloc() failed. %s.\n" // If you use malloc().
    "Error: Cannot get current working directory. %s.\n"
    "Error: Cannot register signal handler. %s.\n"

You should error check all system/function calls and follow a similar
format for your error messages as the ones above.

## Part 6

Your minishell needs to capture the `SIGINT` signal. Upon doing so,
it should return the user to the prompt. Interrupt signals generated
in the terminal are delivered to the active process group, which
includes both parent and child processes. The child will receive the
`SIGINT` and deal with it accordingly. Make sure you use only async-safe
functions in your signal handler.

One suggestion would be to use a single volatile sig_atomic_t variable
`interrupted` that is set to true inside the signal handler. Then,
inside the program's main loop that displays the prompt, reads the input, 
and executes the command, don't do anything if that iteration of the
loop was interrupted by the signal. If read fails, you need to make
sure it wasn't simply interrupted before erroring out of the minishell.
Finally, set `interrupted` back to false before the next iteration
of the main loop.

This assignment is out of 100 points, with 20 points of extra credit available.

## Part 7 (Extra Credit, 10 points)

 Your cd should also support changing into a directory whose name contains spaces. 

Your shell would have to support enclosing the directory name in double quotes, as in

    cd "some folder name"
    cd "some"" folder ""name"

If a quote is missing as in

    cd "Desktop

you should print an error message and return `EXIT_FAILURE`.

## Part 8 (Extra Credit, 10 points)

Your shell should support piping. For example, 

    echo "5\n3\n2\n1\n4\n1" | sort | uniq
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5

Your shell should support a chain of up to 64 processes. The example above shows a chain of 3 processes.


## Sample Executions

Please note that you don't need to match these error messages exactly.
Additionally, these cases are not necessarily exhaustive.

```
